## Overview

Standalone deployment is ideal for development environments or small-scale production setups. This guide walks you through running Linqra components individually with their required backing services.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

1. Set up all required environment variables ([Environment Variables Guide](/api-reference/envvariables))
2. Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
3. Access to the Linqra project repository

## Infrastructure Components

Linqra's standalone deployment requires several backing services:

- **Redis**: Rate limiting and temporary data storage
- **MongoDB**: Application resilience data
- **PostgreSQL**: Keycloak data storage
- **Keycloak**: Authentication and authorization

<Note>
  While we use Keycloak with PostgreSQL by default, you can configure any compatible Identity Provider.
</Note>

## Launch Infrastructure Services

Start the backing services using Docker Compose:

```bash
cd ~/IdeaProjects/Linqra/
```

```bash
/usr/local/bin/docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -p Linqra up
```

<Warning>
  For local development, we provide pre-configured JKS files (self-signed certificates). 
  For production deployments, you must generate your own certificates.
</Warning>

## Configure Identity Provider

After services are running:

1. Access Keycloak at `http://localhost:8281`
2. Follow our [Keycloak Configuration Guide](/api-reference/keycloak) to set up:
   - Realms
   - Clients
   - Roles
   - Scopes

## Deploy Application Components

After setting up the infrastructure services, you'll need to build and deploy the Linqra application components.

### Build JAR Files

Ensure you're in the Linqra root directory:

```bash
pwd
```

The output should show your root directory, for example:
```bash
/Users/mehmetsen/IdeaProjects/Linqra
```

Build the application components using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This command will create the following JAR files:

| Application | Jar File | Type |
| ----------- | -------- | ---- |
| api-gateway | LiteGateway.jar | Gateway |
| discovery-server | DiscoveryService.jar | Discovery |

<Note>
  The JAR files will be created in their respective `target` folders within each component's directory.
</Note>

### Run JAR Files

After building the JARs, you'll need to start each component in the correct order.

### Run the JAR Files from Terminal

#### EUREKA SERVER

1. Start Eureka discovery-server by going to the target folder:

```bash
cd ~/IdeaProjects/Linqra/discovery-server/target/
```

2. Run the jar file along with the truststore jks file:

```bash
java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore="$EUREKA_TRUST_STORE" -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword="$EUREKA_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD" -jar DiscoveryService.jar
```

3. Check the Eureka discovery-server endpoint:

```bash
https://localhost:8761/
```

#### GATEWAY

1. Go to the api-gateway target folder:

```bash
cd ~/IdeaProjects/Linqra/api-gateway/target
```

2. Run the jar file along with the truststore jks file:

```bash
java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore="$GATEWAY_TRUST_STORE" -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword="$GATEWAY_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD" -jar LiteGateway.jar
```

Note that we are not simply using 'java -jar FileName.jar' because SSL requires the truststore parameters to be provided on the command line. These parameters:

```bash
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore="$CLIENT_TRUST_STORE" -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword="$CLIENT_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD"
```

are necessary for establishing secure SSL connections between services. Without them, the applications would fail with SSL handshake errors.

### Run Client Applications

After setting up the core services, you can deploy client applications that integrate with the Linqra gateway.

#### Prepare Client Services

First, ensure you've downloaded the example client applications from their respective GitHub repositories.

For each client application, you'll need to:

1. Enable the environmental variables in your terminal:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

2. Build the application JAR files:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

#### Run Inventory Service

Navigate to the inventory service project:

```bash
cd ~/IdeaProjects/linqra_inventory_service
```

Build the application:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

Navigate to the target directory:

```bash
cd target
```

Run the jar file with SSL configuration:

```bash
java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore="$CLIENT_TRUST_STORE" -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword="$CLIENT_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD" -jar InventoryService.jar
```

#### Run Product Service

Navigate to the product service project:

```bash
cd ~/IdeaProjects/linqra_product_service
```

Build the application:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

Navigate to the target directory:

```bash
cd target
```

Run the jar file with SSL configuration:

```bash
java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore="$CLIENT_TRUST_STORE" -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword="$CLIENT_TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD" -jar ProductService.jar
```

Now the last part. We need to start the web. Here is what we need to add:

Assuming you are still at the root folder. 
go to the web root folder
$ cd edge-service/

Then run the web
$ sudo npm run dev

Go to the https://localhost:3000/
